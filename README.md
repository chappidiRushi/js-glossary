# JavaScript Glossary

This glossary provides brief explanations of common terms and concepts related to JavaScript.

## A

### AJAX
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web pages can send and receive data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

## C

### Closure
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This allows the function to retain access to variables from its containing scope even after the scope has closed.

### Callback Function
A callback function, often referred to simply as a callback, is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a particular event or operation has occurred.

## D

### DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree-like structure, allowing programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

## E

### Event
An event is a signal that indicates that a specific action has occurred. In JavaScript, events can be triggered by user interactions (such as clicking a button or typing on a keyboard) or by other parts of the program (such as loading a web page or receiving data from a server).

### Event Listener
An event listener is a function that listens for a specific event to occur and executes a specified piece of code (the event handler) in response to that event.

## F

### Function
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. Functions allow you to organize code into logical units, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## I

### IIFE
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a JavaScript design pattern that involves defining and immediately executing a function. This pattern is often used to create a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global namespace.

## P

### Promise
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner and more flexible way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

## V

### Variable
A variable is a named storage location that holds data. In JavaScript, variables can store various types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, and functions. Variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

# JavaScript Glossary

This glossary provides brief explanations of common terms and concepts related to JavaScript.

## A

### Array

A data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same type, accessible by an index.

### Arrow Function

A concise way to write anonymous function expressions in JavaScript using the `=>` syntax.

### Async/Await

A pair of keywords used to work with asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, introduced in ES8 (ECMAScript 2017).

### API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

### AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

A technique for creating interactive web applications by exchanging data with a server asynchronously without reloading the page.

### Argument

A value passed to a function when calling it, which can be accessed within the function.

### Assignment Operator (`=`)

An operator used to assign a value to a variable.

### Array Method

A function that operates on arrays to perform tasks like adding, removing, or transforming elements.

### Arithmetic Operator

Operators used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

### Access Modifiers

Keywords used to specify the accessibility of class members in object-oriented programming languages.

### Abstraction

The process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or function.

### Algorithm

A set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or completing a task, often expressed as pseudocode or in a programming language.

### Authentication

The process of verifying the identity of a user or system, often used in web applications to restrict access to certain resources.

### Animation

The process of creating the illusion of motion by displaying a series of images or frames in rapid succession.

### API Endpoint

A specific URL where an API can be accessed and interacted with.

### Array Index

The position of an element in an array, starting from zero for the first element.

### AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator)

A popular library for validating JSON data against JSON Schema definitions.

### Abstract Class

A class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class for other classes to inherit from.

## B

### Boolean

A data type that can have one of two values: true or false.

### Break

A keyword used to exit a loop prematurely, skipping the remaining iterations.

### Bitwise

Refers to operators that perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.

### Block

A group of statements enclosed in curly braces { }, often used to define scope in JavaScript.

### Block Scope

The scope of variables defined within a block, such as within a function or loop.

### Break Statement

A statement used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.

### Browser Object Model (BOM)

A set of objects provided by web browsers, which expose the browser functionality to JavaScript.

### Bind

A method used to create a new function that, when called, has a specified 'this' value and optional initial arguments.

### Buffer

A temporary storage location used to hold data during input and output operations.

### Babel

A JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.

### Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.



## C

### Closure
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This allows the function to retain access to variables from its containing scope even after the scope has closed.

### Callback Function
A callback function, often referred to simply as a callback, is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a particular event or operation has occurred.

## D

### DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree-like structure, allowing programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

## E

### Event
An event is a signal that indicates that a specific action has occurred. In JavaScript, events can be triggered by user interactions (such as clicking a button or typing on a keyboard) or by other parts of the program (such as loading a web page or receiving data from a server).

### Event Listener
An event listener is a function that listens for a specific event to occur and executes a specified piece of code (the event handler) in response to that event.

## F

### Function
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. Functions allow you to organize code into logical units, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## I

### IIFE
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a JavaScript design pattern that involves defining and immediately executing a function. This pattern is often used to create a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global namespace.

## P

### Promise
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner and more flexible way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

## V

### Variable
A variable is a named storage location that holds data. In JavaScript, variables can store various types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, and functions. Variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.
